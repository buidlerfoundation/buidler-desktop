### Welcome, Buidler!

Buidler is a Web3 Messaging App for your community, teams, and supporters to connect, communicate and collaborate.

By perfectly combining social messaging and crypto wallet, the mission of Buidler is to make Web3 more useful for everyone and make Web3 happen. 

**1./ Powerful Group Chat.**

Private and secure by design. Only you, with your seed phrase, can access your messages with built-in end-to-end encryption by default. What happens between us stays with us.

  **2./ Exclusive Space.**

NFTs/Tokens represent membership in the Exclusive Space - a digital club with exclusive access and benefits for members only. It incentivizes anyone who becomes a member (or leaves the Space) to keep or buy back their tokens/ NFTs.

 **3./ Built-in ENS.**

Supported ENS Domain by default helps verify every Profile and Community. A user on Buidler can always know where others come from, thanks to traceable NFTs. There will be no more scams or unreliable communities existing.

 **4./ Wallet-to-wallet, message - payments.**

It helps friend-to-friend payments easy as texting. Native wallet in the app allows members to send and receive tokens quickly, participate in voting, and airdrop much more easily.

  **5./ IPFS Post.**

Official announcements/posts are wallet-verified, signed by team members, and stored on IPFS. This makes them easy to identify as distinct from rumors or inaccurate information, which we try to keep out of our community.  

**6./ Community-driven, open source.**

Read our code and contribute to the repo. Together, as a community, we'll build a better future for Buidler.
